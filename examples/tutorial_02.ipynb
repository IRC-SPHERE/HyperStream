    "# HyperStream Tutorial 2: Your own tools\n",
    "\n",
    "HyperStream has a set of predefined tools in hyperstream.tools. However, it is possible to define your own tools and factors. In this tutorial, we show how to create a simple plugin that reads a CSV file. In this tutorial, we already created the tool and made all the configurations necessary for it to work. We will describe how this one was created, and how can you create a new one.\n",

    "### 1. Create a folder in plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to create a new folder to contain our new tool. The new folder needs to be in the folder __plugins__, in this example __plugins/example/tools/csv_reader/__. We need to create an **\\__init\\__.py** file in every subfolder to be able to treat all the folders as a Python package.\n",
