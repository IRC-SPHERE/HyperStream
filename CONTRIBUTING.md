# Contributing

HyperStream is dependent on the community. 
If you want to help, please post in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/IRC-SPHERE-HyperStream/Lobby) or [email us](mailto:hyperstreamHQ@googlegroups.com). 
If you feel already comfortable you can help by opening issues or make a pull request on GitHub.

We are currently primarily looking for help with:

* User feedback (best via GitHub issues, but email is also fine)
* Backend / API
* Outreach / making HyperStream better known
* Helping with plugins
* Helping with documenting the interfaces or the API
* Frontend / UX / Design of the website
* If you have your own ideas on how you want to contribute, please get in touch!
