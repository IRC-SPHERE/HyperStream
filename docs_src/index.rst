Welcome to HyperStream's documentation!
=======================================

`HyperStream <https://IRC-SPHERE.gihub.io/HyperStream/>`_ is a large-scale, flexible and robust software package, written in the Python language, for processing streaming data with workflow creation capabilities. HyperStream overcomes the limitations of other computational engines and provides high-level interfaces to execute complex nesting, fusion, and prediction both in online and offline forms in streaming environments. HyperStream is a general purpose tool that is well-suited for the design, development, and deployment of Machine Learning algorithms and predictive models in a wide space of sequential predictive problems.

The code can be found on our `Github project page <https://github.com/IRC-SPHERE/HyperStream>`_. It is released under the MIT open source license.
